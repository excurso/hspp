# [HyperSheetsPreprocessor (HSPP)](https://utilizer.de/hspp/)
HSPP is an optimizer and minifier for CSS files written in C++11.

## Why use HSPP?
 * To save your servers bandwidth
 * To speed up network transfer (in most cases it will also lead to better gzip results)
 * To speed up parsing by the browser
 * To improve search engine rating
 * To make your production code harder to read for the others (obfuscation).\
   At the same time your original code will stay unchanged.

## The following operations can be performed by HSPP:
 * Removing of optional whitespace
 * Removing comments (preserving comments containing specific terms is possible)
 * Number minification
 * Color minification
 * Minification of angles
 * Minification of IDs
 * Minification of class names
 * Minification of custom property names
 * Minification of keyframes animation names
 * Rewriting/minifying of some functions
 * Removing of empty rules

## A short description on how HSPP operates
1. Tokenize the input CSS file to a token stream
2. Parse the token stream into an abstract syntax tree (AST)
3. Modify the AST
4. Output the modified AST information to a file or standard output
